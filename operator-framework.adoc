== Operator Framework
include::includes/header.adoc[]

An Operator is an application-specific controller that extends the Kubernetes 
API to create, configure, and manage instances of complex stateful applications 
on behalf of a Kubernetes user. It builds upon the basic Kubernetes resource and
controller concepts but includes domain or application-specific knowledge to 
automate common tasks. 

The Operator Framework 
(https://coreos.com/blog/introducing-operator-framework[intro blog post]) is an 
open source toolkit to manage Kubernetes native applications, called Operators, 
in an effective, automated, and scalable way. Operators take advantage of 
Kubernetes's extensibility to deliver the automation advantages of cloud 
services like provisioning, scaling, and backup/restore while being able to run 
anywhere that Kubernetes can run.

This guide shows how to build a simple Memcached Operator and how to manage its 
lifecycle from install to update to a new version. For that, we will use two 
center pieces of the framework:

* <<operator_sdk>>
* <<operator_lifecycle_manager>>

[NOTE]
====
Requirements: Please make sure that the Operator SDK is installed on the 
development machine. Additionally, the Operator Lifecycle Manager must be 
installed in the cluster (1.8 or above to support the apps/v1beta2 API group) 
before running this guide.

[[operator_sdk]]
=== Build an Operator using the Operator SDK

The Operator SDK makes it easier to build Kubernetes native applications, a 
process that can require deep, application-specific operational knowledge. 
The SDK not only lowers that barrier, but it also helps reduce the amount of 
boilerplate code needed for many common management capabilities, such as 
metering or monitoring. Moreover ,it Allows your developers to build an Operator
based on your expertise without requiring knowledge of Kubernetes API 
complexities.

This section walks through an example of building a simple Memcached Operator 
using tools and libraries provided by the Operator SDK.

[NOTE]
====
Requirements: Please make sure that the 
https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk[Operator SDK],
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[Kubernetes-cli]
and the https://golang.org/doc/install[Go Programming Language] are installed.
Furthermore, make sure that the GOPATH is setup.
====

*_Create a new project_*

Use the CLI to create a new memcached-operator project:

----
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/example-inc/
$ operator-sdk new memcached-operator --api-version=cache.example.com/v1alpha1 --kind=Memcached
$ cd memcached-operator
----

This creates the memcached-operator project specifically for watching the 
Memcached resource with APIVersion = cache.example.com/v1apha1 and Kind = 
Memcached.

[NOTE]
====
Learn more about the project directory structure from the SDK 
https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/project_layout.md[project layout]
documentation.
====

*_Customize the Operator logic_*

For this example, the Memcached Operator will execute the following reconciliation logic for each Memcached custom resource:

* Create a Memcached Deployment if it doesn't exist
* Ensure that the Deployment size is the same as specified by the Memcached 
CustomResource (CR) spec
* Update the Memcached CR status with the names of the memcached pods

*_Watch for the Memcached custom resource definition_*

By default, the memcached-operator watches Memcached resource events as shown in
cmd/memcached-operator/main.go.

----
func main() {
  sdk.Watch("cache.example.com/v1alpha1", "Memcached", "default", 5)
  sdk.Handle(stub.NewHandler())
  sdk.Run(context.TODO())
}
----

*_Define the Memcached spec and status_*

Modify the spec and status of the Memcached CRD at pkg/apis/cache/v1alpha1/
types.go:

----
type MemcachedSpec struct {
	// Size is the size of the memcached deployment
	Size int32 `json:"size"`
}
type MemcachedStatus struct {
	// Nodes are the names of the memcached pods
	Nodes []string `json:"nodes"`
}
----

Update the generated code for the CR:

----
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/example-inc/
$ cd memcached-operator
$ operator-sdk generate k8s
----

*_Define the Handler_*

The reconciliation loop for an event is defined in the Handle() function at 
pkg/stub/handler.go.

Replace this file with the reference implementation found 
https://github.com/operator-framework/getting-started/blob/master/handler.go.tmpl#L7[here]. 
You will need to update the highlighted line if you have changed the import path
of this project to something other than “example-inc”.

[NOTE]
====
Update: Update the code you just replaced with the updated code
https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/commit/34c317ef90e63a5e4d6ed29ca1826ee32b16f112#diff-7bcd1b78beaf078c430fa8d1fcc8ef2e[here].
====

[NOTE]
====
Note: The provided handler implementation is only meant to demonstrate the use 
of the SDK APIs and is not representative of the best practices of a 
reconciliation loop.
====

*_Build and run the Operator_*

Build the memcached-operator image and push it to a registry. Please make sure 
you have a an account on Quay.io for the next step, or substitute your 
preferred container registry. 
On the registry, https://quay.io/new/[create a new public image] repository 
named “memcached-operator”.

----
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/example-inc/
$ cd memcached-operator
$ operator-sdk build quay.io/example/memcached-operator:v0.0.1
$ docker push quay.io/example/memcached-operator:v0.0.1
----

Kubernetes deployment manifests are generated in deploy/operator.yaml. The 
deployment image is set to the container image specified above.

*_Deploy the Memcached Operator_*

----
$ kubectl create -f deploy/rbac.yaml
$ kubectl create -f deploy/crd.yaml
$ kubectl create -f deploy/operator.yaml
----

*_Verify that the Operator is running_*

----
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                  READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
memcached-operator-75c4b4c665-8jnj5   1/1       Running   0          20s
----

*_Clean up_*

----
$ kubectl delete -f deploy/operator.yaml
$ kubectl delete -f deploy/rbac.yaml
----

[[operator_lifecycle_manager]]
=== Manage the Operator using the Operator Lifecycle Manager

The previous section has covered manually running an Operator. In the next 
sections, we will explore using the Operator Lifecycle Manager which is what 
enables a more robust deployment model for Operators being run in production 
environments.

The Operator Lifecycle Manager helps you to install, update, and generally 
manage the lifecycle of all of the Operators (and their associated services) on 
a Kubernetes cluster. It runs as an Kubernetes extension and lets you use 
kubectl for all the lifecycle management functions without any additional tools.

*_Generate an Operator manifest_*

The first step to leveraging the Operator Lifecycle Manager is to create a 
manifest. An Operator manifest describes how to display, create and manage the 
application, in this case Memcached, as a whole. It is required for the Operator
Lifecycle Manager to function.

For the purpose of this guide, we will continue with this 
https://github.com/operator-framework/getting-started/blob/master/memcachedoperator.0.0.1.csv.yaml[predefined manifest] 
file for the next steps. If you’d like, you can alter the image field within 
this manifest to reflect the image you built in previous steps, but it is 
unnecessary. In the future, the Operator SDK CLI will generate an Operator 
manifest for you, a feature that is planned for the next release of the Operator
SDK.

*_Deploy the Operator_*

Deploying an Operator is as simple as applying the Operator’s manifest to the 
desired namespace in the cluster.

----
$ curl -Lo memcachedoperator.0.0.1.csv.yaml 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/operator-framework/getting-started/master/memcachedoperator.0.0.1.csv.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f memcachedoperator.0.0.1.csv.yaml
$ kubectl get ClusterServiceVersion-v1s memcachedoperator.v0.0.1 -o json | jq 
'.status'
----

After applying this manifest, nothing has happened yet, because the cluster does
not meet the requirements specified in our manifest. Create the 
CustomResourceDefinition and RBAC rules for the Memcached type managed by the 
Operator:

----
$ kubectl apply -f deploy/rbac.yaml
$ sed '/---/q' deploy/operator.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
----

Because the Operator Lifecycle Manager creates Operators in a particular 
namespace when a manifest has been applied, administrators can leverage the 
native Kubernetes RBAC permission model to restrict which users are allowed to 
install Operators.

*_Create an application instance_*

The Memcached Operator is now running in the memcached namespace. Users 
interact with Operators via instances of CustomResources; in this case, the 
resource has the Kind Memcached. Native Kubernetes RBAC also applies to 
CustomResources, providing administrators control over who can interact with 
each Operator.

Creating instances of Memcached in this namespace will now trigger the Memcached
Operator to instantiate pods running the memcached server that are managed by 
the Operator. The more CustomResources you create, the more unique instances of 
Memcached will be managed by the Memcached Operator running in this namespace.

----
$ cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: "cache.example.com/v1alpha1"
kind: "Memcached"
metadata:
  name: "memcached-for-wordpress"
spec:
  size: 1
EOF
$ cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: "cache.example.com/v1alpha1"
kind: "Memcached"
metadata:
  name: "memcached-for-drupal"
spec:
  size: 1
EOF
$ kubectl get Memcached
NAME                      AGE
memcached-for-drupal      22s
memcached-for-wordpress   27s
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                       READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
memcached-app-operator-66b5777b79-pnsfj    1/1       Running   0          14m
memcached-for-drupal-5476487c46-qbd66      1/1       Running   0          3s
memcached-for-wordpress-65b75fd8c9-7b9x7   1/1       Running   0          8s
----

*_Update an application_*

Manually applying an update to the Operator is as simple as creating a new 
Operator manifest with a replaces field that references the old Operator 
manifest. The Operator Lifecycle Manager will ensure that all resources being 
managed by the old Operator have their ownership moved to the new Operator 
without fear of any programs stopping execution. It is up to the Operators 
themselves to execute any data migrations required to upgrade resources to run 
under a new version of the Operator.

The following command demonstrates applying a new [manifest_v2][Operator 
manifest] using a new version of the Operator and shows that the pods remain 
executing:

----
$ curl -Lo memcachedoperator.0.0.2.csv.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/operator-framework/getting-started/master/memcachedoperator.0.0.2.csv.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f memcachedoperator.0.0.2.csv.yaml
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                       READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
memcached-app-operator-66b5777b79-pnsfj    1/1       Running   0          3s
memcached-for-drupal-5476487c46-qbd66      1/1       Running   0          14m
memcached-for-wordpress-65b75fd8c9-7b9x7   1/1       Running   0          14m
