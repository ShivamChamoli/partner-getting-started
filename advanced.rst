Advanced Topics
===============

.. I don't like the term "advanced", but it's a bit of a catch-all for things that
   I wouldn't consider part of every experience. These won't be copy/paste from the
   OpenShift developer guide, but rather trimmed down versions to inform partners
   of their existence and usefulness. References to the appropriate sections in the
   developer guide will be provided.
