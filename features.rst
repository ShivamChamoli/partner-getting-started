Using OpenShift Features
========================

.. I need a better title for this, but this is how to add OpenShift-ness to their
   application: using environment variables to make their containers configurable,
   creating templates to ease deployments, creating a builder image that they want
   users to build from (is this needed? sounds like something that might be useful),
   and how to add health checks to their container
