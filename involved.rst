Get Involved
============

There are a number of ways to engage with the OpenShift teams and begin
to promote new integrations and ideas.

* Signing up for `OpenShift Primed <https://www.openshift.com/primed/>`_
  is the first step towards raising awareness of ISV integrations with OpenShift.
* The `OpenShift Blog <https://blog.openshift.com/>`_ hosts posts on a
  variety of topics. In particular, the
  `partners <https://blog.openshift.com/tag/partners/>`_ tag highlights
  posts written by ISV teams to showcase their integrations.
* Joining `OpenShift Commons <https://commons.openshift.org/>`_ facilitates
  collaboration and awareness of project involvement with OpenShift.
  Additionally, regular `briefings <https://commons.openshift.org/briefings.html>`_
  are hosted and allow a deeper dive into a particular topic.
