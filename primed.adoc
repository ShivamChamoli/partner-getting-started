Red Hat OpenShift Primed is a technical readiness designation that acknowledges 
the first steps of an ISV's technology working with OpenShift by providing the ISV a 
designated logo and awareness through OpenShift online properties such as
https://hub.openshift.com/[Hub] and https://commons.openshift.org/[OpenShift Commons]. 
To earn this designation, ISVs must demonstrate an initial commitment to OpenShift.
